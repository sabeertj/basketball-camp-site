                    <h3>Arjun Prakash, CEO and Co-Founder</h3>
                    <div class="about-text">
                        <p>My name is Arjun Prakash, and I’m a high school student in the Class of 2025 with over 9 years of experience playing basketball. I’ve competed for 5 years in AAU circuits and spent 6 years playing school basketball — including 3 years at the high school varsity level. Throughout that time, I’ve developed a deep understanding of the game, both technically and mentally, and I’ve seen firsthand how powerful sports can be in shaping discipline, leadership, and confidence.</p>
                        <p>Basketball has been a major part of my life. It’s pushed me to work harder, think smarter, and perform under pressure. The time I’ve spent training, competing, and being part of a team has taught me lessons I carry well beyond the court. Now, I’m taking what I’ve learned and creating a space where younger athletes can grow through those same experiences.</p>
                        <p>This camp is built by players who know what young athletes need — because we were in their shoes not long ago. We focus on building real skills, basketball IQ, and smart habits that players can carry into their seasons and beyond. Our sessions are intense, focused, and designed to help athletes of all levels improve — whether they’re just starting or preparing for competitive play.</p>
                        <p>But just as important, we wanted this camp to have purpose beyond basketball. That’s why a portion of all proceeds will be donated to a cause that matters to us. Giving back is part of our mission. We believe sports can do more than develop players — it can bring people together and support something bigger.</p>
                        <p>This is a real camp run by real players who know the game and care about doing things the right way. If you're ready to put in work, improve your game, and be part of something meaningful — we’d love to have you join us.</p>

                    <div class="about-text about-cofounder-text">
                        <p>I’m a high school student in the Class of 2026 with nearly a decade of basketball experience. Over the past 10 years, I’ve developed my skills through 6 years of competitive AAU basketball and 3 years of school basketball, including 2 years playing at the high school level. My journey has been built on consistent effort, competing against strong opponents, and learning to adapt and improve in every situation.</p>
                        <p>Basketball has been a major part of my life, but I’ve always believed improvement comes from more than just natural talent. It takes focus, discipline, and the willingness to put in the hard work day after day. I’ve experienced firsthand what real development looks like — through countless practices, games, and challenges — and I know how important it is for young players to have guidance that’s both practical and honest.</p>
                        <p>That’s why I helped co-found this basketball camp. Our goal is to provide serious training that pushes athletes to get better while keeping the environment straightforward and focused. We want to give players clear feedback, the right fundamentals, and the kind of skill-building that prepares them for whatever level they’re aiming for. This camp is designed for players who want to improve with purpose — no fluff, no shortcuts.</p>
                        <p>Beyond the training, we’re committed to making a positive impact off the court as well. A portion of all proceeds from the camp will be donated to a meaningful cause. We believe in using the platform we have as athletes to contribute to something larger than ourselves, and that responsibility is just as important as the work we do in the gym.</p>
                        <p>As co-founder, I’m dedicated to running a camp that delivers real value and helps players build confidence through consistent progress. We’re building more than just skills — we’re building a foundation for athletes to grow on and carry with them long after the camp ends.</p>
