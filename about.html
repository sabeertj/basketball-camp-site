                <h3>Arjun Prakash, CEO and Co-Founder</h3>
                <div class="about-text">
                    <p>My name is Arjun Prakash, and I’m a high school student in the Class of 2025 with over 9 years of experience playing basketball. I’ve competed for 5 years in AAU circuits and spent 6 years playing school basketball — including 3 years at the high school varsity level. Throughout that time, I’ve developed a deep understanding of the game, both technically and mentally, and I’ve seen firsthand how powerful sports can be in shaping discipline, leadership, and confidence.</p>
                    <p>Basketball has been a major part of my life. It’s pushed me to work harder, think smarter, and perform under pressure. The time I’ve spent training, competing, and being part of a team has taught me lessons I carry well beyond the court. Now, I’m taking what I’ve learned and creating a space where younger athletes can grow through those same experiences.</p>
                    <p>This camp is built by players who know what young athletes need — because we were in their shoes not long ago. We focus on building real skills, basketball IQ, and smart habits that players can carry into their seasons and beyond. Our sessions are intense, focused, and designed to help athletes of all levels improve — whether they’re just starting or preparing for competitive play.</p>
                    <p>But just as important, we wanted this camp to have purpose beyond basketball. That’s why a portion of all proceeds will be donated to a cause that matters to us. Giving back is part of our mission. We believe sports can do more than develop players — it can bring people together and support something bigger.</p>
                    <p>This is a real camp run by real players who know the game and care about doing things the right way. If you're ready to put in work, improve your game, and be part of something meaningful — we’d love to have you join us.</p>
